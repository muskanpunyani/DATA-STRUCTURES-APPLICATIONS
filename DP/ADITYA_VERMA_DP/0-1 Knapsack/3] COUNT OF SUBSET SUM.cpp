Given an array arr[] of integers and an integer sum, the task is to count all subsets of the given array with a sum equal to a given sum.

Note: Answer can be very large, so, output answer modulo 109+7

Example 1:

Input: N = 6, arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}
       sum = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: {2, 3, 5}, {2, 8}, {10}

Example 2:

Input: N = 5, arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       sum = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 5}, 
             {2, 3, 5}


Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function perfectSum() which takes N, array arr[] and sum as input parameters and returns an integer value

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*sum)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*sum)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N*sum ≤ 106

**********************************

Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Example 1:

Input: N = 4
arr = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: YES
Explaination: 
The two parts are {1, 5, 5} and {11}.

Example 2:

Input: N = 3
arr = {1, 3, 5}
Output: NO
Explaination: This array can never be 
partitioned into two such parts.


Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function equalPartition() which takes the value N and the array as input parameters and returns 1 if the partition is possible. Otherwise, returns 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*sum of elements)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*sum of elements)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000
